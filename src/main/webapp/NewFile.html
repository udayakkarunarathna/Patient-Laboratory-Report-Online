			PERERA BHT : 2113092 ROOM NO : 9906 AGE : 52 years/8 months SAMPLE
			COLLECTED: 09/09/2021 06:55 AM SERVICE REF. NO : NSL077711222 PRINTED

			PAGE 01 Specimen :- A) Radical prostetectomy. -------- B) Left pelvic
			lymph nodes C) Right pelvic lymph node Macroscopy:- A) Radical
			prostetectomy specimen measuring 45mm from Apex to base,50mm
			---------- from right to left and 50mm from anterior to posterior.
			The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are identified. The left
			anterior surface was marked with orange ink and left posterior with
			blue ink. The right anterior surface with black and right posterior
			surface with right ink. The specimens was serially sliced from Apex
			to base and all embedded. (Blocks A1 to A36) B) Fat covered tissue
			measuring 50x40x20 mm. Four lymph nodes identified. C) Fat covered
			tissue measuring 50x45x20 mm. Six lymph nodes identified.

			Microscopy:- A,B and C ---------- --------- Sections confirm the
			presence of a small acinar type prostatic adenocarcinoma, volving the
			right and left lobe posteriorly and extending to anteriorly to both
			lobes. Total tumour volume is 60% of the volume of the right lobe 50%
			of the volume of the left lobe. It is predominantly composed fused
			glands with back to back appearance and cribriform areas. (Gleason
			grade 4) with single separete glands (Gleason grade 3) in a fibrous
			stroma. The tumour does not invade the prostatic capsule or extand to
			the periprostatic fat. All surgical resection margins are not
			involved by the tumour except at the apex showing foci of tumour. The
			closest margin is the posterior right margin and is 0.5mm away from
			the tumour. No vascular invasion. No perineural invasion. The
			surgical resection margins of the base and both seminal vesicles are
			not involved by tumour. The prostatic urethra shows normal urothelium
			with no dysplasia. Foci of high grade prostatic intra epithelial
			neoplasia (PIN) are not seen. Four lymph nodes from left pelvic nodes
			and six nodes from right pelvic nodes are free tumour deposits. PAGE
			02 Conclusion :- A) Radical prostetectomy. ---------- B) Left pelvic
			lymph nodes C) Right pelvic lymph node Tumour type - Prostatic
			Adenocarcinoma - Small acinar type Tumour grade - ISUP/WHO Grade
			group - III Gleasons score (4+3) = 7 Tumour burden - Right lobe -
			Tumour occupies 60% of the volume of the right lobe. Left lobe -
			Tumour occupies 50% of the volume of the left lobe Surgical resection
			margins - Apex - Involved by tumour. Base - Not involved by tumour.
			Circumferential - Not involved by tumour. closest margin is the
			posterior Right margin 0.5mm away penetration of prostate capsule -
			Absent vascular invasion - Absent Perineural invasion - Absent
			Seminal vesicles - Not involved by tumour. Left pelvic lymph nodes -
			Four nodes with no tumour deposits (0/4) Right pelvic lymph nodes -
			Six nodes with no tumour deposits (0/6) Tumour Stage - pT2cN0
